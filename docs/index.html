<h1>Julia University</h1>
<p>"The university is a community of scholars and students engaged in the task of seeking truth. It is a body which administers its own affairs regardless of whether it derives its means from endowments, ancient property rights, or the state; or whether its original public sanction comes from papal bulls,
    imperial charters, or the acts of provinces or states. In every case its independent existence reflects the express wish or continuing toleration on the part of the founder. Like the church, it derives its autonomy - respected even by the state - from an imperishable idea of supranational, world-wide character:
    <strong>academic freedom</strong>. This is what the university demands and what it is granted. Academic freedom is a privilege which entails the obligation to teach truth, in defiance of anyone outside or inside the university who wishes to curtail it.</p>
<p>The university is a school, but of a very special sort. It is intended not merely as a place for instruction; rather, the student is to participate actively in research and from this experience will acquire the intellectual discipline and education which will remain throughout the student's life.
    Ideally, the student thinks independently, listens critically, and is self-responsible. The student has the freedom to learn."</p>
