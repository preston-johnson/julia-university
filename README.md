# Julia University
A free (gratis & libre), open-source tool for learning the Julia programming language.

## Roadmap
1. A Julian implementation of the [Math](https://openstax.org/subjects/math) and [Physics](https://openstax.org/subjects/science) textbooks provided by [OpenStax](https://openstax.org). Source filepaths currently adhere to the following semantic syntax: Subject.Book.Chapter.Section (e.g., 1.1.3.2 -> Algebra.Pre-Algebra.Integers.Add-Integers)
2. A web-based Julian spreadsheet application for linguistic experimentation, information exploration, and data visualization.
3. TBD
